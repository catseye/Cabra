Cabra
=====

This is the reference distribution for Cabra, a formal programming language
whose programs form an idempotent semiring under certain operations.

For a definition of the Cabra language automaton, see the file `cabra.html`
in the `doc` directory.  (Which should probably be converted to Markdown
someday, but that day is not today.)

There is also a reference implementation of the language in Haskell
in the `src` directory.
